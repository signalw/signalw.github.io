<p>Boring or not, I created a new blogpage and&nbsp;it would be my first blog that written in English. I could communicate with others in English quite well, but as long as I write an article in English, I feel strange. So&nbsp;I was thinking maybe I should switch into my mother tongue. In fact, I am not ready to concentrate myself in a mood. Anyway, this is my opening article. And I want a wonderful 2012!</p><p><br></p><p>PS: So much had happened last year. I must&nbsp;spare some time&nbsp;to review the sweetness and bitterness of that year. The coming year for me is still full of challenge!</p>
